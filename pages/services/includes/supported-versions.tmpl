## Package Versioning Scheme

- {{ model.techName }}: latest stable at the time of the release, refer to the package version.
- DC/OS: 1.10 or higher.

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of {{ model.techName }}. For example, `2.1.1-{{ model.supportedVersions.techExampleVersion }}` indicates version `2.1.1` of the DC/OS integration and version `{{ model.supportedVersions.techExampleVersion }}` of {{ model.techName }}.

## Version Policy

The DC/OS {{ model.techName }} Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of {{ model.supportedVersions.techLink }}. We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected the latest stable version of {{ model.techName }} for new releases.
